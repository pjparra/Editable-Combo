Did you ever feel the need to have that smooth, simple and effective OS-X-like listboxes, in which you can simply add, edit or remove items, on your webapp?

Well, no need to search anymore, you just found what you need. I felt this need when creating an administration interface for a website. After several searches, I didn't find any jquery plugin that did it the way I wanted. So I created it. It is really convenient to use. Let's suppose you want a page to manage users and groups. You could do it the usual way: create your groups, then create your users and assign them to groups. And if you miss one group, go back to the groups page, add a new group, then return to the users page, and assign your users to that group. Or you can do it another way: have one single page for users and groups, and lighten all this a little bit. You can create groups, users, with these nice looking OS-X-like listboxes. Your users page is basically the same, except there are two litlle "+" and "-" buttons below your groups combobox. So if you miss a group, just click "+", and create your group, then assign your users to that group. No more need to navigate between pages. So much easier, so much faster, so much more intuitive.
